        The Grid is a distributed network of Lifter aircraftâ€”resilient,
        redundant, and built for affordable mass at scale. Operating as a mesh
        rather than a hub-and-spoke, it delivers cargo anywhere, anytime. Each
        new Lifter extends coverage and capacity across vast, contested regions,
        turning logistics into a flexible, on-demand network.
